        "This lab covers the core components of `pandas`, with a focus on elements of `pandas` used in machine learning. It covers loading a structured data file (CSV and JSON) as a `DataFrame`, and sorting, selecting, and filtering the resulting `DataFrame`. The lab also covers common data parsing and wrangling challenges like duplicate entries and missing data. It covers the basic of data wrangling and manipulation in Python using `pandas`, as well as the fundamentals of creating plots in Python using `matplotlib`.\n",

It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "22. \"pandas adopts significant parts of NumPy's idiomatic style of array-based computing, especially array-based functions and a preference for data processing without for loops...the biggest difference is that pandas is designed for working with tabular or heterogeneous data.
